# M9k Remastered: Throwables

Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2205783122

# Description:

**'Throwables' is an extension for M9k Remastered.**

M9k: Remastered is a massive improvement over the original M9k addons.

We dumped the original code and then made new modern code for maximum performance.

⠀

**For the best experience we recommend avoiding playing in Singleplayer.**
**Start a Multiplayer session instead.**

\> The addon was designed with Multiplayer in mind just like 99% of other addons.

\> We made it compatible with Singleplayer, but you might run into issues.

# Compatibility

M9k: Remastered is **not** compatible with original/legacy M9k addons.

Weapons and packs have to be coded specifically for M9k: Remastered to function properly.

⠀

**All non-M9k: Remastered packs have to be removed.**
